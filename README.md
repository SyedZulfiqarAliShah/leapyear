NewRepoHED
This is a new Repository created for practice of HED Coursera Certifications. 
Now I have created a new branch called "Child_br" and I am updating the FReadMe file by adding these comments in the Readme file of Child_br.
Actually when a new branch is created from the existing branch, then all files of the existing branch are automatically available in the new sub-branch. I do not forget to commit changes after every file update.
