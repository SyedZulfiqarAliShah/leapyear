NewRepoHED
This is a new Repository created for practice of HED Coursera Certifications. 
Now I have created a new branch called "Child_br" and I am updating the FReadMe file by adding these comments in the Readme file of Child_br.
Actually when a new branch is created from the existing branch, then all files of the existing branch are automatically available in the new sub-branch. I do not forget to commit changes after every file update.
One more important point: all changes made in the child branch will not be available in the parent branch automatically.
For this purpose Pull request is used to merge both the branches.
Now I am going to press the button "Compare & Pull request" for merging the two branches and combining the changes. But this must be done while child branch is active branch.
